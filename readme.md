## Abstract ##
According to a recent statistical analysis conducted in 2018, more than 40% of the population has no reading or writing skills especially in rural areas of Pakistan. On the contrary, the mobile phone users have grown at a very steep rate even with a stagnant literacy rate. We formed a user-driven approach to research, develop and test a prototype mobile application that could be used to teach illiterates basic reading, writing and counting skills without using traditional schooling techniques.

## Our Mission ##
* Teach people to evaluate and question their sources.
* Making thoughtful cultural and platform decisions.
* Expanding conceptions of Digital world.


## Domain Description ##
The domain at which we will be working is **Educational**. The reason behind selecting this domain is because learning to read and write is expensive and inaccessible to most of the 8 million adult illiterates in Kenya (and 775 million worldwide). WE are creating a mobile platform that will provide universally accessible, affordable and personalized education to illiterate adults. The app is designed for people with zero-low school attendance, and teaches reading and writing lessons through bite-sized exercises.

Digitally literate teachers see technology for all of its creative potential, rather than something they are mandated to do. Digital literacy does not require that teachers become experts, but it does require that they understand the digital tools that can unlock their deeper teaching potential.
